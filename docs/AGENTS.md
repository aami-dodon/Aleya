# Docs Agent Notes

- Document any repository review or knowledge-base updates in `docs/Wiki.md` so the history stays chronological.
- When introducing new documentation under `docs/`, include actionable summaries and reference the underlying code when possible.
- Keep `docs/features.md` current whenever feature availability changes.
- The visual token reference in `docs/theme.html` should stay aligned with the classes in `frontend/src/index.css`; refresh the examples if you adjust the theme.
