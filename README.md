# Aleya
Aleya is a journaling and mentorship app that helps people reflect on their emotions, build habits, and grow with guidance.

## Vision & Purpose

Who is it for? Individuals who want to journal for self-growth, mentors who want to support them, and administrators who manage the platform.

Why now? Modern life is treated in fragments—body, mind, work, spirit—so advice often pushes only one path while the rest is ignored. Aleya takes a holistic approach: rooting in self-care, building purpose, branching into learning and relationships, and expressing creativity. Like a tree with roots, trunk, branches, and fruit, life is whole only when all parts work together.
